# game-jam-shooter

This is a small game jam project first begun on the weekend of April 13-14. It was used in a Game Jam in our local Codelympians club.

All code is original code, using the Processing 3 API library. https://processing.org/

The program is a simple version of "Space Invaders," where the player controls a small spaceship to navigate the screen, shooting enemies while avoiding enemy's projectiles. The player controls movement with the WASD keys, and shoots with the E key. The player wins after 20 enemies are killed.

The main class is the Shooter.java class containing the driver method. The player class defines the player, enemy class defines the enemies, and the projectile class defines the projectiles.

This project is still a work in progress, and I will continue to return to and update it. There are still many unimplemented methods and variables, that I will incorporate and update over time.
