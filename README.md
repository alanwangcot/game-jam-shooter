# game-jam-shooter

This is a 2-day game jam project made on the weekend of April 13-14. It was used in a local Game Jam in our local Codelympians club.
All code is original code, using the Processing 3 API library. https://processing.org/
I created this project without consideration for efficiency or optimization, and Processing 3 was most likely not the best library to use when creating games.

The program is a simple version of "Space Invaders," where the player controls a small spaceship to navigate the screen, shooting enemies while avoiding enemy's projectiles. The player controls movement with the WASD keys, and shoots with the E key. 

The main class is the Shooter.java class containing the driver method. The player class defines the player, enemy class defines the enemies, and the projectile class defines the projectiles.

I do not consider this project 100% complete/perfect/optimized, and intend on returning to it in the near future.
